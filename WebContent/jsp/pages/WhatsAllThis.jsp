    Hello, you've reached the website of Christopher Raser.  Everything here is
    for my own ammusement; your opinions count for nothing.

    <p>
    However, if you feel the need to get in touch with me, I can be reached at 
    (address presented as an image to
    discourage spammers):
    </p>

    <p>
    I'm a professional software developer, working primarily in Java, and this is
    my personal playground.  In order to stay employed in this industry, you
    must stay current.  Which means I need someplace where I can shoot myself in 
    the foot, repeatedly, with a wide variety of firearms, just to get a good look
    at the damage.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    So it's ugly.  I'm a programmer, not a graphic artist.  There's a reason they
    don't let us techies design anything: we're bad at it.  Just look at the way we
    dress.

    <p>
    Actually, I dress pretty well.  Which reminds me: I saw this on a t-shirt
    today:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
    The world is a cruel place when you're a heterosexual with good taste and a
    great eye for color.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Google turned up <a
    href="http://www.straight-up.com/site/front.html">Paul Stroilis <i>Straight Up
    With a Twist</i></a>.  (Tragically, it seems his good taste doesn't extend to
    web design.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
    One last thing.  A friend of mine recently said (and I have it in an email,
    dude, so don't say you didn't):
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    Blogs are an evil byproduct of the internet.  Web logs must
    die.  Yes.  Die.  Even the name must be forgotten.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The writing here, like everything else, is just for me, or for my friends and
    family.  Many people have moaned loudly about what a joke it is that most
    people just use the Internet to post pictures of their dog.  Well:
    </p>

    <p>
    <img src="img/chloe3.jpg" alt="Chloe" />
    </p>

    <p>
    That's not even my dog.  That's my roomate's dog.  She ate my peanut butter
    english muffin the other day, and seemed to enjoy it just as much as I 
    would've.  So I really can't be mad.
    </p>

    <p>
    Though, for what it's worth, I hate the word "blog" too.
    </p>
